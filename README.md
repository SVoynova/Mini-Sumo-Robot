# Mini-Sumo-Robot-Competition

The objective of this project is to design, build and test two autonomous mini-sumo robots which aim to push each other out of the ring.
Its focus is intended to be towards embedded software and sensors, more specifically.

#1. Overview of the rules of the competition between the two robots

Two self-controlled robots are placed in a ring. The robots try to avoid falling out or avoid being pushed out by the opponent robot. The first robot that touches outside of the ring loses the round.

Autonomous Sumo robots are self-propelled and self-controlled, without tethers.
After positioning and starting the robot, no remote control, power, positioning, or other help can be provided. The robot must care for itself until the round ends.

The first robot to win two rounds, wins the match. Different robots compete one-on-one against each other throughout the contest. The robot that wins the most matches wins the contest.

#2. Robots

This project features 2 Zumo Robots for Arduino v1.2.
The Zumo robot is a low-profile tracked robot platform intended for use with an Arduino as its main controller. It measures less than 10 cm on each side and weighs approximately 300 g with an Arduino Uno and batteries (165 g without, as shipped), so it is both small enough and light enough to qualify for Mini-Sumo competitions.
